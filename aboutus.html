              SAEINDIA is India's leading resource for mobility technology. As an individual member driven society of mobility practitioners the ownership of SAEINDIA wrests with its members who are Individuals from the mobility community, which includes Engineers Executives from Industry, Government Officials, Academics and Students SAEINDIA is an affiliate society of SAE International registered in India as an Indian non-profit engineering and scientific society dedicated to the advancement of mobility industry in India. The officers in Section Governing Boards, Operating boards and Committees share the onus of its efficient functioning here. All efforts are on now with a single minded purpose to propel the automotive engineering profession by focusing on three trends occurring in the automotive industry today that affect all automotive engineers and engineering societies. The first of these trends is simultaneous engineering the integration of the roles of design engineer, manufacturing engineer, supplier, marketer, and planner. The second trend is the increased reliance of auto manufacturers on suppliers and design houses to support the design and manufacturing functions. A third factor crucial to an internationalized auto industry is standards as communication, as a basis for regulation, and as an aid to interchangeability. Global standards have become a necessity, and the responsibility for developing them falls on internationally recognized standards-writing groups and, ultimately, on the individual engineers who participate in standards work. During its hundred plus years, the automotive industry has achieved remarkable progress in both production output and technological development. However, associated with this progress has been a slight yet noticeable lag in the level of technological development as compared to the increase in production volume. The founding principle of the SAE International is to unite scientific and technical staff to perform free academic discussions, to dedicate themselves to the cause of prospering the science and technology for automotive vehicles and to make contributions to speed up the modernization of automotive industry. A great deal of effort has been expended to make these definitions suit this purpose. It is recognized quite well by both SAEINDIA and SAE International which keeps on raising its bar on standards since like linguistic dictionaries; even our efforts and purpose must be revised periodically to reflect current usage and changing needs.

                SAE India Collegiate Club, GNDEC was started in 2004 by the Department of Mechanical Engineering to enhance the participation of students in practical activities and events being organised from time to time. This helps to bridge the gap between the theoretical learning and its application in practical situations. The club works under the aegis of Dr. Sehijpal Singh Khangura ( HOD, Mechanical Engineering) and Dr. Harmeet Singh ( Faculty Advisor, SAE India Collegiate Club, GNDEC). The activities are managed by a student committee consisting of Convenor, Co- Convenors, PRO’s, Event Heads which helps to instill leadership qualities in students. The club organises technical events from time to time in every semester and at the college technical festivals like Atharva, GENESIS, etc. Also, members of this club participate in various national and international level student design competitions like SUPRA SAEINDIA, BAJA SAEINDIA, SAE NIS Efficycle. The club also organises expert talks of various industrialists and scholars so that industry-institute gap can be reduced and passing out engineers can be made more ‘Industry-Ready’.
